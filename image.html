        <p>Mathematics is also the language of the universe, from the electrochemical signals in our brain 
            to the equations of General Relativity which govern the motion of stars and galaxies everywhere in the <br>
        It is one of humanity's most noble endeavours to understand the universe we live in, and that would 
            not be possible without mathematics.</p>

        <h2 id="comp">COMPUTER</h2>
        <p>A computer is described as an electronic device because; it is made up of electronic components and uses electric energy (such as electricity) to operate.

            A computer has an internal memory, which stores data & instructions temporarily awaiting processing, and even holds the 
            intermediate result (information) before it is communicated to the recipients through the Output devices.
            
            It works on the data using the instructions issued, means that, the computer cannot do any useful job on its own.
             It can only work as per the set of instructions issued.
            
            A computer will accept data in one form and produce it in another form. The data is normally held within the computer as it is being processed.</p>

        <h2 id="phy">PHYSICS</h2>
        <p>physics, science that deals with the structure of matter and the interactions between the fundamental constituents of
             the observable universe. In the broadest sense, physics (from the Greek physikos) is concerned with all aspects of nature 
             on both the macroscopic and submicroscopic levels. Its scope of study encompasses not only the behaviour of objects under the 
             action of given forces but also the nature and origin of gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear force fields. Its ultimate objective is the formulation of a few comprehensive principles that bring together and explain all such disparate phenomena.</p>
